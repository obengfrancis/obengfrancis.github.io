          <!-- Teaching Philosophy -->
          <div class="teaching-section">
            <h3>My Teaching Philosophy</h3>
            <p>
              I view teaching as an evolving practice that benefits from reflection, feedback, and ongoing professional development. I regularly seek feedback from my students to understand their needs and adjust my teaching strategies. I stay current with computer science and pedagogy advances, integrating new tools and approaches that enhance student learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              My teaching philosophy is based on the belief that effective computer science education should combine theory and practice, foster inclusivity, and empower students to become independent, collaborative problem-solvers and lifelong learners. This philosophy is achieved through active learning, practical experiences, and inclusive and diverse learning environments.
            </p>

            <h4>Core Teaching Principles</h4>

            <div class="philosophy-item">
              <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">1. Active Learning</strong>
              <p>
                As an instructor, I integrate active learning practices to help students gain a deeper understanding of lessons and grasp lecture materials. Rather than blending teaching lectures for students to only receive information, I design lessons and learning experiences that engage students through hands-on projects and practice solving real-world problems by collaborating in groups.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                <em>Example:</em> A lesson on for-loops in Java includes a presentation starting with a real-life example, explanation of structure and syntax, demonstration with hands-on practice, and group activities where students work together to implement Java programs integrating for-loops.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="philosophy-item">
              <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">2. Practical Examples (Real-World Applications)</strong>
              <p>
                I believe the most effective way to prepare students for industry careers is by providing authentic, hands-on practice that simulates real-world software development. I integrate practical software engineering tools and practices into my courses, including version control, unit testing, and code reviews—critical skills required in the software development industry.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                Students engage in realistic programming projects and collaborative exercises such as pair programming, debugging sessions, and peer code reviews, simulating the teamwork and communication required in professional environments. I also incorporate relevant software engineering research findings to inform students of current trends and cutting-edge developments.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="philosophy-item">
              <strong style="display: block; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">3. Diversity and Inclusion</strong>
              <p>
                Having taught students from varied educational and cultural backgrounds—from middle school and high school in Ghana to undergraduate and graduate courses at Virginia Tech—I am equipped with the skills and experiences to create an inclusive, diverse, and conducive classroom environment where every student feels welcomed, valued, and supported.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
                I create accessible course materials that accommodate different learning styles and preferences, make course requirements and expectations clear, and employ differentiated instruction to provide multiple pathways for engagement. This ensures that all students can succeed regardless of their starting point, race, gender, sexual orientation, or background.
              </p>
